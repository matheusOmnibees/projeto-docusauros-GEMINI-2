![imagem-8](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-8.webp)

## Settings:
In this tab, you will need to fill in the fields for **“Main Details”** and **“Sales Period and other Information”**:

### Main Details:

![imagem-9](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-9.webp)

*   **Name**: define the name of the rate and then translate it by clicking on **“Translate”**.
*   **Commercial Name:** define the name of the rate that will be displayed on search portals, and then translate it.
*   **Description**: insert details about the rate to be created.
*   **Rate Type**: inform what the rate type will be:
    *   **Net**: for net rate price _(for this type, if a ‘mark-up’ is entered for the sales channels, the system will consider it for informational purposes only. However, if ‘commissionable’ information is entered incorrectly, the system will add the informed percentage to the rate value)._
*   **Commissionable** for public rate price _(for this type of rate, if a mark-up is entered in the sales channels, the system will **subtract** the informed percentage from the rate value.)._
*   **Currency**: select the currency type for the rate.
*   **Availability Type**: inform what the availability type will be (how the quantity of room types for sale will be distributed):
    *   **Apartment:** the real inventory (total number) of room types will be distributed.
    *   **Rate:** you can distribute by ‘allotment’; breaking down the total number of room types by rates.
    *   **Rate with inventory impact:** possibility to distribute in a ‘mixed’ way, rates by ‘apartment’ type and by ‘rate/allotment’ type. _(Note: it is worth noting that the ‘allotment’ registered for this type of rate will be deducted from the hotel's real inventory, impacting the occupancy of rates that have ‘rate type: apartment’.)_
*   **Rate Category**: choose from the category types: General/ Rack, Promotion, Group, Company, Weekend, Events/ Fairs, **Agreement Rate**, Opaque, Government, Travel Industry, Net, Trade, and Family.

## IMPORTANT TO KNOW
**WHEN SELECTING THE “AGREEMENT RATE” OPTION, THE SYSTEM WILL UNCHECK THE “PUBLIC RATE” FIELD IN THE AGENCIES AND COMPANIES TABS, ALLOWING FOR INDIVIDUAL CONFIGURATION OF THE CHANNELS IN THESE TABS THAT ARE PART OF THE AGREEMENT. (SEE MORE INFORMATION ON PAGES 12 to 16).**

## Agencies:
The ‘agencies’ are connected to the **‘TMC Channel’** and, in this tab, you can assign them to the rate.
When you select **“Public Rate”**, the system will ***“automatically assign all Travel Agents from the "TMC Channel" to this rate, if it is assigned in the channel list”***, without needing to assign them individually to the list of assigned agencies (on the right)_.

![imagem-25](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-25.webp)

![imagem-26](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-26.webp)

If the rate is being created for agreement rate strategies, when selecting the **“Agreement Rate”** option in the **Rate Category**, on the **Settings** tab, the **“Public Rate”** option will be automatically unchecked.
You will need to **assign only the agencies with which the hotel has agreements**, individually, by clicking the **“+”** icon next to the agency's name or by **“dragging and dropping”** the agency(s) into the list of assigned agencies (on the right).

![imagem-27](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-27.webp)

When assigning them to the rate, you can apply a **price variation**:

![imagem-28](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-28.webp)

![imagem-29](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-29.webp)

*   **GDS:** allows applying price variations, in _“currency or percentage”_, which can be _“added or subtracted”_ from the rates intended for agencies that purchase via GDS (_Amadeus_, _Sabre_, and _Travelport_).

## Company:
The ‘companies’ are connected to the **“Company Channel”** and, in this tab, you can assign them to the rate.
And here too, when you select **“Public Rate”**, the system will ***“Automatically make this rate available to all Travel Agents and Companies”***, without needing to assign them to the list of ‘assigned companies’ on the right:

![imagem-30](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-30.webp)

![imagem-31](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-31.webp)

If the rate is being created for agreement rate strategies, when selecting the **“Agreement Rate”** option in the Rate Category, on the Settings tab, the **“Public Rate”** option will be automatically unchecked.
You will need to **assign only the companies with which the hotel has agreements**, individually, by clicking the **“+”** icon next to the company's name or by “dragging and dropping” the company(s) into the list of assigned companies (on the right):

![imagem-32](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-32.webp)

![imagem-34](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-34.webp)

## IMPORTANT TO KNOW!
**THE COMMISSION SETTINGS (COMMISSIONABLE OR MARK-UP TYPES) AND ‘PAYMENT TYPES’ MADE FOR THE TMC CHANNEL AND COMPANY CHANNEL, IN THE CHANNELS TAB, WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL AGENCIES AND COMPANIES ASSIGNED TO THE RATE.**

## Included Extras:
In this tab, the “included extras” created in the **“Property Management > Extras”** tab will be available to be assigned to the rate.
To do this, click the **"+"** sign next to the name of each extra. Or, **“drag and drop”** the extra into the list of assigned extras (on the right):

![imagem-35](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-35.webp)

When assigning an “included extra” to the rate, you can define if it will be **“Available for different Periods”**. To do this, select the extra, click **“Edit”** and enter the dates it will be available in **“From — To”** and then, click **“ok”**:

In this tab, the “additional extras” created in the **“Property Management > Extras”** tab will be available to be assigned to the rate.
And, to assign them, click the **"+"** sign that appears in front of the name of each extra; or, **“drag and drop”** the extra into the list of assigned extras (on the right):

![imagem-37](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-37.webp)

In this tab, it will also be possible to **“Assign all hotel extras”** automatically, without needing to assign them manually - for this, just enable this option:

![imagem-38](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-38.webp)

## IMPORTANT TO KNOW!
*   **FOR ADDITIONAL EXTRAS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO APPLY THE “AVAILABLE FOR DIFFERENT PERIODS” SETTING.**
*   **THE ADDITIONAL EXTRA CAN BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOOKING ENGINE CHANNEL (OMNIBEES BOOKING ENGINE), ALLOWING THE GUEST TO PURCHASE IT DURING THE BOOKING PROCESS. THE VALUE WILL BE ADDED TO THE TOTAL RESERVATION AMOUNT.**
*   **SOME OPERATORS, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF INTEGRATION, CAN VIEW AND PURCHASE ADDITIONAL EXTRAS ALONG WITH THE RESERVATION (TO LEARN MORE, REQUEST THE LIST OF OPERATORS FROM OMNIBEES SUPPORT).**

## Offers:
The offers created in the ***“Rates and Availability > Offer”*** tab will be available to be assigned to the rate in this tab.
And, to assign them, click the **"+"** sign that appears in front of the name of each offer; or, **“drag and drop”** it into the list of assigned offers (on the right):

![imagem-39](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-39.webp)

When assigning more than one offer to the rate, it is possible to activate the **“Cumulative”** option so that the discounts of the offers with this option selected are summed and applied to the reservation value. Otherwise, the system will apply only the offer with the most advantageous discount.
And here, the information for **“Booking Period”** and **“Stay Period”** will also appear if they were configured when the offers were created:

![imagem-40](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-40.webp)

## Policies:
The policies created in the ***“Property Management > Policies”*** tab will be available to be assigned to the rate in this tab.
For the **“General Policies**, **Payment Guarantee Policies and Cancellation Policies”** you will need to select a default policy:

![imagem-41](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-41.webp)

To apply policies for different periods in the **“Payment Guarantee Policies** and **Cancellation Policies”**, you can assign additional policies to the rate after selecting the default policy.
To do this, click the **“+”** icon displayed next to the name of each policy or **“drag and drop”** the policy into the list of assigned policies (on the right).

![imagem-42](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-42.webp)

Next, you will need to inform the periods in which each policy will be available, using the **“Available for different periods”** field. To do this, select the desired policy and click **“Edit”**.

![imagem-45](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-45.webp)

## IMPORTANT TO KNOW!

*   **WHEN ASSIGNING THE BOOKING ENGINE CHANNEL TO A PACKAGE RATE, A “SPECIAL OFFERS” BUTTON WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE BOOKING ENGINE PAGE.**

![imagem-46](/assets/guia-myhotel-tarifarios/imagem-46.webp)
